B075ZY6N2Q,Adri,5,Worth it!,"Works just a advertised. Even though it's the 5MP sensor and older version of the pi-cam, the quality of images are good and the camera lens is better than the standard module lens. The IR lamps are bright and well designed. Currently usimg it with a raspberry pi 4B. Definitely would recommend this.",05/02/2021,0.9325

In the product image they shows the camera with the lights left and right side, but lights missing in the package. also I am not able to cancel or replace this order.
